# The Weather App

## Description

This is a fantastic weather app that will give you today's forecast as well as the 5-day forcast of any city. In addition to being able to see the weather of any city, previous locations are saved onto the sidebar using local storage for a faster search on the next visit. 

The site is also responsive to any device all the way down to an iPhone 5

## Usage

This application is being deployed by GitHub and can be viewed at: https://andrethetallguy.github.io/WeatherApp/

Upon landing on the page, a user can type in a city of their choosing and the application will pull from two APIs to populate the data. 

Upon returning to the page, a user can click on the prepopulated buttons pulled from local storage.
